# Welcome to PintInterest 🍻

PintInterest is a mobile app that allows users to keep track of the beers they have tasted and rate them. In the app, the user can add a new beer, give it a star rating (1–5), add a description, and take a photo of the bottle or can. The listed beers can be viewed and filtered, for example, based on the star rating.

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).
